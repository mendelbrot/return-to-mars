## Return To Mars

This is a planetary motion simulation turned into a game.  You are piloting a space ship that was on a mission beyond the orbit of Mars when a collision with a micro-asteriod permenantly disabled your comm and main navigation computer.  To survive, you will need to pilot your ship back to Mars.  

Win condition: both your speed and distance relative to Mars go below preset values at the same time.

Loose Condition: X number of Martian years have passed and you run out of life support.
